### Literature Review

Grad students are required to review a recent paper
regarding design patterns.

1. Pick a paper published in a recent (i.e. in the last ~5 years)
reputable conference (e.g. ICSE, OOPSLA/SPLASH, ECOOP)
or journal (e.g. IEEE Software, ACM TOSEM).

2. Ideally, the paper should be about design patterns,
but anything related to object-oriented programming is acceptable.

3. Send the paper link to the instructor for approval.

4. Prepare a review of the paper as a report. A "review" is a serious job.
   In particular, focus on the following things:
   * What is the paper about? What problem does it address? What are the assumptions about its problem context?
   * How does the paper solve the problem?
   * What are the strengths and weaknesses?
   * How can the paper be extended for future work?
   
   Reading papers that cite the picked paper is a smart trick to quickly
   see what other researchers think about this paper.

5. At the end of the semester, you will
submit the report, and present the paper in class.
