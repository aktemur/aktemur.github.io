Spring 2015, Spring 2016, Summer 2016, and Fall 2016.

### Audience
This course is targeted towards students who want to improve their object-oriented
programming skills and experience. We mainly discuss what makes an OO software
flexible, extensible, maintainable and easy to document.
This is a project course where the student has to develop a program of non-trivial size.

Background: The course is built on the assumption that
you know basic OO concepts, such as class, inheritance,
abstract class, instantiation, interface, static vs. non-static
method, public/private visibility, etc.
In particular, you must have taken the [CS 102](http://srl.ozyegin.edu.tr/cs102)
course, or equivalent.
