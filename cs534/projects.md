## Projects
You are required to deliver a term project.
Projects should be done in pairs.
Expectations from the grad students are higher than
undergrad students.

You will be required to give a demo of your project at the end of the
semester.

You have to use a version control system.
I will create a GitHub repository for you and grant you access.

You are free to choose the programming language you will use for implementation,
as long as the language is object-oriented.
Java, C++, C#, Smalltalk, Python, Ruby are among acceptable options.

### Deliverables
The following are the deliverables of the project:

+ **Setup (due: Nov. 11th, 14:00)**: Send an email to the course TA
  that includes the names of the team members and their GitHub IDs.
+ **Submission (due: Jan. 4th, 10:00)**: You will give a **live demo** of your code.
  Be prepared to answer design- and code-related questions.
  Include a README file in your repo that explains how to compile and
  run your code. UML class diagrams of key parts of your projects
  should be available in your repository as well.
