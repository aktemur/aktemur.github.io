## TDD Lab Practice
* Your task in this practice is to write test cases for a `Clock` class. The code
exists in the public repository.
* A `Clock` object represents the daily time.
* Take a look at the methods declared in the given `Clock` class.
  For each method, write test cases in the given (and currently empty)
  `ClockTest` class in the `test` package.
* Carefully design your test cases to cover corner cases.
* `Clock`'s constructor should throw `IllegalArgumentException`
  if the hour, minutes, or the seconds parameters are not proper values.
  (E.g. 79 is illegal for seconds, 30 is illegal for the hour.)
