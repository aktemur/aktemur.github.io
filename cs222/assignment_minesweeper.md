your Eclipse workspace. 
See the [resources page](resources.html) for pointers.

The project contains a file named **MineSweeperNew.java**, taken from
[here](http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=4853&lngWId=2),
and another file, named **Written.txt**.

Then type your answers to the following questions in the
**Written.txt** file.
