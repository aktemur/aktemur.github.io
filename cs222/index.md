From the backcover of _Clean Code_ by Robert Martin:

> Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees.
> Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.
> But it doesn't have to be that way. 

This is the webpage of the **CS 222 Programming Studio** course at Ozyegin University. 
The purpose of this course is to make you a better programmer.
After taking this course, the code you write will be more readable, maintainable and extensible.
You will also learn how to use refactoring, debugging and versioning 
tools effectively.
Check this page regularly to keep up with the announcements.


This course is inspired greatly from the <a href="https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/cs242fa14/Home">CS242 course</a> 
taught at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
We thank
Mike Woodley, Charlie Meyer, Sam Kamin, and Nick Chen
for their help and feedback.

This course has previously been offered in
every Spring semester starting 2012, and also Summer 2016.
Spring 2016 and Summer 2016 offerings
were taught by Buse Yilmaz.
