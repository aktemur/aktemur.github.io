## Academic integrity
Violations of scholastic honesty include, but are not limited to cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of previous or current assessments, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students. Any act of scholastic dishonesty is a serious academic violation and will result in a disciplinary action. The assessment in which plagiarism is detected will receive -100 points.

You are encouraged to study together with your friends. You may discuss course topics and homeworks with other people; however, all homeworks are individual unless otherwise specified. This means that you have to write down your own solutions for the problems given as homeworks. 

[Rule of thumb:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) If you are looking at the solution to a problem that was written by somebody else, or if you are making your solution available to somebody else in whatever format (e.g. verbally, by sending an email, by instant messaging, by writing on the board, etc.), you are violating the academic integrity. If you are in doubt whether an action you take is a violation or not, don't do it! 

See [a longer version of the honor code](honorCode.html), adapted from [Stanford University Computer Science Department's Honor Code](http://csmajor.stanford.edu/HonorCode.shtml").

## Format
The purpose of this course is to improve your coding skills in the correct way.
This will be done through numerous programming assignments.

Every week, you will attend a lecture plus a discussion session.
In the lecture you will be introduced to good habits about programming and you will be given an
assignment.

In the discussion session, a solution submitted by a student
will be reviewed. This will give you feedback to clean up your code.

## Interaction
We will be using [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) for offline discussion. 
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. 
Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, 
I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. 
You may ask questions you have regarding the assignments, 
course topics, the project, etc. 
Caution: **NEVER post exam and homework solutions to Piazza.** 

Find our class page at: <http://www.piazza.com/>.

## Grading
Grading will be based on the following:

* Midterm exam 1: 10%
* Midterm exam 2: 15%
* Midterm exam 3: 10%
* HW1: 15%
* HW2: 15%
* HW3: 10%
* Final exam: 25%

Both the exams and the homeworks will be in the form
of programming assignments;
there are no exams in the traditional written style. 

The homework assignments will be given in multiple parts.
You will be graded when all the parts are complete.

**Unless otherwise stated, all work is individual.**

**No makeup is possible for homeworks.**

**Midterm exam make-up:**  
It is possible to take a make-up exam if you miss a midterm exam based on a valid excuse.
A formal letter (e.g. a doctor’s report) should be submitted for any kind of excuses.
A make-up will be granted only for **one** missed midterm exam.

**Bütünleme exam:**
There will be no make-up for the final exam;
the composite (i.e. bütünleme) exam serves that purpose.
University-wide büt exam rules apply for this case.

You may request a regrade on any graded item within **1 week** after the corresponding
scores have been posted. After 1 week, regrade requests will not be accepted.
To request a regrade, email the instructor. Your grade may go up or down after the regrade.

Letter grade is determined based on a curve.
A total score below 40/100 is guaranteed to receive a failing grade
regardless of the distribution of scores
(note that a total score of 40 or above does not guarantee a passing grade).

## Legal
The instructor reserves the right to change the policy at any time.
