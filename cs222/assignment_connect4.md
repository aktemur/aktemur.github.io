# Assignment: Connect4

**Grading deadline:** The most recent version of your code at the time of
**April 6th, 23:55** will be used for grading.

**Part I**: To receive feedback on Part I, 
submit until **March 13th, 14:30**, by committing your code to SVN.

**Part II**: To receive feedback on Part II, 
submit until **March 20th, 14:30**, by committing your code to SVN.

**Part III**: To receive feedback on Part III, 
submit until **March 27th, 14:30**, by committing your code to SVN.

In this assignment, we will be working with code
in the `connect4` package.
In any part, do NOT change the signature of the public methods
you've been provided with.
You may add new **private** methods and fields,
unless otherwise specified.

_Keep in mind that you do not have to
commit your code just once.
I suggest you to commit your code whenever you implement
a new feature. This way, you will also have a backup of your code.
We will use the most recent version of your code available at the specified deadline._

## Grading
Roughly, the criteria will be as shown below,
however, this is subject to fine-tuning. Details will be provided as they become available.

* Coverage of test cases (HW2.1): 14 pts
* Cleanness of test cases (HW2.1): 9 pts
* Correctness of HW2.2: 18 pts
* Cleanness of HW2.2: 13 pts
* MVC structure in HW2.3: 10 pts
* Correctness of HW2.3: 13 pts
* Cleanness of HW2.3: 13 pts
* Participation in code review sessions: 10 pts

Correctness will be auto-graded using test cases.


## Problem Definition

I want to play a game.
It is Connect4.
Familarize yourself with the game here:
<http://connect4.gamesolver.org/>

## Part I

Implement test cases for the `Board` class.
You should NOT implement the `Board` class, yet.
First, write test cases in the `BoardTest` class.
Do your best to cover all the important scenarios and corner cases.

## Part II

Implement the `Board` class.
Ideally, all your test cases should pass when you're done 
(assuming that you have a well-written test suite
with good coverage).

## Part III

Implement a GUI for your program
according to the MVC pattern.
Here, the `Board` is the model.
