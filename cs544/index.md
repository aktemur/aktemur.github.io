This is the webpage of the **CS 544 Compilers** course 
at [&Ouml;zyegin University](http://ozyegin.edu.tr), 
taught by [Dr. Baris Aktemur](..).

The prerequisite for this course is _CS 201 Data Structures and Algorithms_.
CS 544 is a programming-heavy course.
Having taken a programming languages course (e.g. CS 321)
and a computer architecture course (e.g. CS 240)
is quite helpful, but not required.

This course has previously been offered in Spring 2016.

*Course TA* is Baris Ozcan (<baris.ozcan.10097@ozu.edu.tr>).
