### Academic integrity
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will not be tolerated. Violations will be reported to the disciplinary council of the School of Engineering and the unit in which plagiarism was detected will receive 0 points. A "unit" is defined to be an assignment, project or an exam.

You are encouraged to study together with your friends. You may discuss course topics and assignments with other people; however, all assignments are individual unless otherwise specified. This means that you have to write down your own solutions for the problems given as assignments. 

[Rule of thumb:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) If you are looking at the solution to a problem that was written by somebody else, or if you are making your solution available to somebody else in whatever format (e.g. verbally, by sending an email, by instant messaging, by writing on the board, etc.), you are violating the academic integrity. If you are in doubt whether an action you take is a violation or not, don't do it! 

**NEVER make your solutions public (e.g. on GitHub).**

See [a longer version of the honor code](honorCode.html), adapted from [Stanford University Computer Science Department's Honor Code](http://csmajor.stanford.edu/HonorCode.shtml").

### Interaction
We will be using [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) for offline discussion. 
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. 
Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, 
I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. 
You may ask questions you have regarding the assignments, 
course topics, the project, etc. 
Caution: **NEVER post assignment solutions to Piazza.** 

Find our class page at: <http://www.piazza.com/>.

### Homeworks
All homeworks are **individual**, unless otherwise noted.

### Grading
For **undergraduate students**,
grading will be made according to the following weights:

+ Midterm exam: 25%
+ Final exam: 35%
+ Homeworks: 40% 

For **graduate students**,
grading will be made according to the following weights:

+ Midterm exam: 25%
+ Final exam: 35%
+ Homeworks: 30% 
+ Paper review: 10%

Letter grade is determined based on the total score received from the
exams and homeworks using the following table:

| Total Score | Grade |
|-------------|-------|
| [90,100]    | A  |
| [85-90)     | A- |
| [80-85)     | B+ |
| [75-80)     | B  |
| [70-75)     | B- |
| [65-70)     | C+ |
| [60-65)     | C  |
| [55-60)     | C- |
| [50-55)     | D+ |
| [45-50)     | D  |

The grade intervals may be adjusted slightly at the end of the semester
according to the overall class performance and the difficulty
of the assessments.

A make-up will be granted only for one missed exam (final or midterm),
provided that the student presents a valid excuse.

You may request a regrade on any graded item within **1 week** after the corresponding scores have been posted. 
After 1 week, regrade requests will not be accepted.
To request a regrade, email the instructor. 
Your grade may go up or down after the regrade. 

### Coding Standard
Ugly-looking code will be penalized.
Always label your files with your name, using a comment block at the very top of the file.
Indent your code properly.

### Misc.
Attendance to the lecture will not be recorded except for statistical purposes 
(i.e. will not affect your grade).

If you are late, do not use the stage-level door to enter the classroom. 
Use the back-side doors instead. Pay extra care not to create disturbance.

The course policy is tentative; the instructor reserves the right to change the policy any time.
You will be notified in this case.
