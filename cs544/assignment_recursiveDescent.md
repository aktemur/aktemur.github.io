# Assignment: Recursive Descent Parsing

EaC2 gives a recursive descent parser for the
classic arithmetic expression language in Figure 3.10.
Implement this parser in your favorite programming language.
Make sure to include test cases.
Also include a brief `README.txt` file that explains
how to compile and run your code.

Upload a ZIP or TAR file to LMS. In the bundle,
include your source code, the `README.txt` file,
and your test cases.

For simplicity, you may assume that the input
will contain single-digit integers,
single-character identifiers, and no whitespace.
With this assumption, you won't need a "scanner";
a character in the input will correspond to a token.
If you wish, however, you may write a separate lexer
to tokenize the input first. It is up to you.
