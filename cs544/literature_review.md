### Literature Review

Grad students are required to review a recent paper.

1. Pick a paper published in a recent (i.e. in the last ~5 years)
reputable conference (e.g. PLDI, CC, CGO)
or journal (e.g. ACM TACO).

2. The paper should be about compilers
(i.e. programming language implementation, program analysis,
program transformation, etc.).

3. Send the paper link to the instructor for approval.

4. Prepare a review of the paper as a report. A "review" is a serious job.
   In particular, focus on the following things:
   * What is the paper about? What problem does it address? What are the assumptions about its problem context?
   * How does the paper solve the problem?
   * What are the strengths and weaknesses?
   * How can the paper be extended for future work?
   
   Reading papers that cite the picked paper is a smart trick to quickly
   see what other researchers think about this paper.

5. At the end of the semester, you will
submit the report, and present the paper in class.
