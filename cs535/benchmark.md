## Assignment: Benchmark

Implement the following lock algorithms:
TAS, TTAS, Backoff, ALock, CLH, MCS.
Then, do a benchmark to measure their overhead.
Plot each lock's overhead on a time vs. number of threads
graph (e.g. see Figure 7.4 in the book).
Interpret the results.

**Due**: Nov. 26th, Thursday, 23:55

**Submission:** Create a folder named **Benchmark** in your
repository. This folder shall contain your source code,
as well as a PDF file where you give 
the experimental results.
