### Installing OCaml

* Go to [OCaml.org](http://ocaml.org) and follow
  the instructions to install the latest version of OCaml.

* I recommend that you install `opam` as well.

* Optional but highly recommended:
  Install `ledit` for more convenience when using the OCaml interpreter.
  You can install `ledit` by running

      opam install ledit

  It may be available in your favorite package manager as well. E.g.

      brew install ledit

  Once installed, add the following line to your
  `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file:

      alias ocaml='ledit ocaml'
