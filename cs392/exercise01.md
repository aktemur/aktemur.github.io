## Exercise 01

Open up a Swift playground.
Write Swift code for a super simple Bank:

* A bank has customers.
* A customer has name and an account.
* An account has account number, balance, and owner.
* Write the `Customer`, `Account` and `Bank` classes.
* Money can be deposited or withdrawn from accounts.
* Write some test code to create a few Customer, Account and Bank objects;
  add customers to the Bank, etc.
* Write `description` methods to print the account information of customers.

### Objectives

* What's the difference between `let` and `var`?
* How do you initialize an object? i.e. What's the equivalent of a constructor in Swift?
* How do you refer to the current object? i.e. What's the equivalent of `this` in Swift?
* What's `nil`?
* What's an option type? E.g. What is the difference between `var account: Account?` and `var account: Account`.
* How do you declare and use (i.e. iterate, access and modify) arrays?
